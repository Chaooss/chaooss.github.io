	<p>In the section below we are reviewing how to implement image into our web page</p>
<img src="https://external-content.duckduckgo.com/iu/?u=http%3A%2F%2Fradiusblocks.com%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2022%2F09%2Fimage-grid_3.jpg&f=1&nofb=1&ipt=e16d91369359b10a3fc624537aa4035732ffe31576f743e99cd9a312cadf7ade&ipo=images" alt="bridge leading into forest" height="250" width="350" >
<p>As you can see we have implemented an image from the web using the link from the image and putting it directly into our code, we have also included the image's width and height. That way we can easily define how big we want our image to be.</p>
<p>Also almost forgot to mention that (img) tag is self-closing tag which means it only needs (> sign) to be closed</p>
